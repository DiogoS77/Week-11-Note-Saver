//This code exports a middleware function named clog that logs the type and path of each request to the server.

//The clog function is defined as an arrow function that returns another arrow function.
//Inside the clog function, the request method (req.method) and path (req.path) are extracted.
//The function uses a switch statement to log the request type and path in different formats based on the method. 
//GET requests are logged with "ðŸ“—", POST requests with "ðŸ“˜", and other requests with "ðŸ“™". The fgCyan variable is used to add cyan color to the logs.
//The next() function is invoked to pass control to the next middleware function in the request-response cycle.
//Finally, the clog function is exported as an object with the key clog using module.exports, allowing it to be imported and used in other files as middleware for logging requests.
