//This code sets up an Express server that listens on a specified port (either the value of process.env.PORT or 3001 if not provided). 
//It includes the necessary middleware and route handlers to serve static files, handle API requests, and handle specific routes.

//The express module is imported and an instance of the application is created.
//Middleware for parsing JSON and URL-encoded data is added to the application.
//The /api route is handled by the api router imported from the ./routes/index.js file.
//The public directory is served as static files using express.static middleware.
//The root route '/' is handled by sending the index.html file located in the public directory.
//The '/notes' route is handled by sending the notes.html file located in the public directory.
//The '*' route is a catch-all route that handles any other routes and sends the 404.html file located in the public directory.
//The server starts listening on the specified port, and a message is logged to the console indicating that the server is running.
//In summary, this code sets up a basic Express server with static file serving, API routes, and specific route handlers for '/', '/notes', and 404 errors.
